What is this?
this is a module for BlitzMax that extends the openb3dmax module with a 3D positional sound system.

Requirements
This module is included with the openb3dmax module. Additionaly it requires the BRL.Audio module. It can easily be modified for use as a regular import file if you are not using minib3d as a module, but as an include.

Installation 
To install in the BlitzMax IDE choose "Build Modules" from the "Program" menu. After building, it is recommended that you chose "Document Modules..." from the Program menu to build/update the documentation for this module in the help system.

Usage
Install the module and add "Import openb3dmax.b3dsound" to the top of your source (right below "Import openb3dmax.b3dglgraphics").

To Do
I would love to add in a world sound system that would handle how objects interact with the sounds (sounds playing on the other side of a house should sound like there's a house in the way...) but I'm not a sound engineer so I think that is probably beyond my capabilities. Though if anyone has any thoughs/info please contact me.
